# Leaflet_Challenge - Visualizing Earthquake Data with Leaflet

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

In this challenge a new set of tools will be build which allow the visualisation of earthquake data. The project consists of two parts - a basic visualisation of an earthquake data set and a map that illustrates the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.


## Method

* Data Visualisation


## Technologies

* JavaScript
* HTML, CSS
* GeoJson


### Leaflet part 1

A basic visualisation utilising an earthquake data set from [USGS GeoJSON Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) is created by a json from the URL to transform the data into a a map that displays the seismic activity.

### Leaflet part 2

A second data set is plotted onto the map highlighting the relationship between the tectonic plates and seismic activity. The data for the second data set is retrieved from https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates.
